Blueprint 2.0 plan

1. upgrade to R4.3 OSGi release.
	Not r5.0 because Felix is stil on R4.3
2. Fix bugs.
3. Add an ability to specify extra intercaces to proxy on import
	Those interfaces are not to be used in filter criteria. Useful in situations where dealing with frameworks that add aditional interfaces to proxys, i.e. ecf.
4. Publish p2 update site
5. Publish releases to maven repo.
