      <title>Start Level Integration</title>

      <para>A future release of Gemini Blueprint may offer the following
      additional guarantee with respect to application context creation and
      start levels:</para>

      <para>Application context creation happens asynchronously. However, the
      extender bundle does guarantee that the creation of all application
      contexts for bundles at start level <literal>n</literal> will be
      complete before the creation of any application context at start level
      <literal>m</literal>, where <literal>m > n</literal>. Care must
      therefore be taken not to introduce any mandatory dependencies on
      services exported by bundles with higher start levels or a deadlock will
      be introduced.</para>

      <para>In a similar vein, when shutting down the extender bundle,
      application contexts at start level <literal>m</literal> will be shut
      down before application contexts at start level <literal>n</literal>,
      where <literal>m > n</literal>.</para>
