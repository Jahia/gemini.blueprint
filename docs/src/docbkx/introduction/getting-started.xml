    <title>Getting Started</title>

    <para>Learning a new framework is not always straightforward. In this section, we (the Spring DM/Gemini Blueprint team) 
    tried to provide, what we think is, an easy to follow guide for starting with Gemini Blueprint. 
    Of course, feel free to create your own learning 'path' as you see fit and, if possible, please report back
    any improvements to the documentation that can help others.</para>

    <section id="get-started:first-steps">
		<title>First Steps</title>
		
		<para>As explained in <xref linkend="why-Spring DM"/>, Gemini Blueprint provides integration between
		Spring framework and OSGi. Thus, it is important to become acquainted with both of these frameworks (libraries or
		environments depending on how you want to name them). Throughout the Gemini Blueprint documentation, each section provides
		links to resources relevant however, it is best to become familiar with these topics beforehand.</para>
		  
		<section id="get-started:first-steps:spring">
			<title>Knowing Spring</title>
			<para>Gemini Blueprint uses heavily Spring framework's <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/spring-core.html">core</ulink> functionalty, 
			such as the <ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/beans.html">IoC</ulink> container,
			<ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/resources.html">resource</ulink> abstraction and
			<ulink url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html">AOP</ulink> infrastructure. While it is not important
			to know the Spring framework APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum, the idea behind IoC should be familiar.
			That being said, the more knowledge you have about Spring framework, the faster you will pick Gemini Blueprint.
			Besides the comprehensive documentation that explains the Spring Framework in detail,
			there are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on the topic - take a look at the Spring framework
			<ulink url="http://www.springsource.org/documentation">home page</ulink> for more information. In general, this should be the starting point for 
			OSGi (or Eclipse plugin) developers wanting to try Gemini Blueprint.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="get-started:first-steps:osgi">
			<title>Knowing OSGi</title>
			<para>Java developers, new to OSGi, can start by reading the OSGi Alliance <ulink url="http://www.osgi.org/About/HowOSGi">introduction</ulink>,
			the OSGi <ulink url="http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage">specifications</ulink> or one of the articles/blogs 
			available on the internet (such as the SpringSource <ulink url="http://blog.springsource.com/category/osgi/">blogs</ulink>).
			Additionally, the Gemini Blueprint home <ulink url="http://www.springframework.org/osgi">page</ulink> hosts various links to useful materials.
			</para>

		<section id="get-started:first-steps:blueprint">
			<title>Quick start - OSGi 4.2 Blueprint Container</title>
			<para>As an alternative to the recommended Spring documentation, if OSGi 4.2 is an option, one can read the Blueprint Container specification
			for a quick introduction to dependency injection and Gemini Blueprint functionality. Note that Blueprint is a subset of Spring and Gemini Blueprint and we recommend
			the official documentation to get access to the whole set of features.

		<section id="get-started:first-steps:samples">
			<title>Trying Out The Samples</title>
			<para>Once one is familiar with the concepts behind Spring and OSGi, she can start reading the Gemini Blueprint reference documentation (this document) and
			take the Gemini Blueprint samples for a spin. The samples are available either in the .zip distribution or from the Gemini Blueprint repository.
			The samples are a convenient way to get started quickly with Gemini Blueprint as they show various features of Gemini Blueprint and help one get pass the 
			initial struggles with OSGi. However, they are not meant as the definitive guide in using OSGi rather, they aim to be a launching pad 
			for "newbies" trying out OSGi in Spring.
			</para>
			<para>The current distribution contains:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Simple Service Sample</para>
					<para>A simple example that illustrates OSGi service publication and consumption through Gemini Blueprint. This is a good starting point
					for users learning the basics.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Weather Sample</para>
					<para>A demo that shows more advanced features of Gemini Blueprint and OSGi. The application creates a very simple weather information services 
					presenting some best practices in designing an application to take advantage of the modularity offered by OSGi.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Simple Web App Sample</para>
					<para>As the name implies, this is a simple web application, containing Servlets, JSPs and JSP tags, that runs inside OSGi through Gemini Blueprint.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Web Console Sample</para>
					<para>A more complicated sample that demos a Spring MVC annotation based, web application that runs inside OSGi through Gemini Blueprint, featuring 
					class path scanning and various Spring taglib. Additionally, the web application interacts with the OSGi environment through the web UI.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist> 
			<para>Each project contains instructions regarding its content and startup procedure. Users are encouraged to experiment with the samples to get a better
			understanding of the technologies used.</para>
